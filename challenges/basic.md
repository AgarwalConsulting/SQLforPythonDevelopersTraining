# Basic Challenges

## 1. Library Management System

You are tasked with designing a database for a library management system. The system should allow the library to keep track of:

  - Each book has a title, an author, a publication year, and a unique identifier (ID).

- Members
  - Members have a name, an email address, and a unique identifier (ID).

  - Members can borrow books.

- Borrow Records
  - Track which members borrowed which books, along with the date of borrowing and the return date.

## Design a Book Shop
